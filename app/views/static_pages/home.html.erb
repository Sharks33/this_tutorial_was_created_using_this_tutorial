        This Tutorial was made to walk even the most novice user through the complete set up and instalation process of a Raspberry Pie running Raspbian and Retropie! It is designed to provide clear and consise instructions to get the user set up with a fully functional mini computer capable of handleing everyday use such as word processing and web surfing, development (this tutorial was built on one) and emulating pretty much any gaming console or computer prior to the release of the PS2.
